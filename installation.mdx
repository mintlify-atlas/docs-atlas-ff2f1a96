# Installation

The Composable Architecture can be added to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager.

## Requirements

Before installing, ensure your project meets the minimum platform requirements:

- iOS 16.0+
- macOS 13.0+
- tvOS 16.0+
- watchOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Swift Package Manager

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open package dependencies">
    In Xcode, navigate to **File** → **Add Package Dependencies...**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter the repository URL">
    Enter the following URL into the package repository URL text field:
    
    ```
    https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add to your target">
    Depending on how your project is structured, choose one of the following options:
    
    ### Single application target
    
    If you have a single application target that needs access to the library, add **ComposableArchitecture** directly to your application target.
    
    ### Multiple targets
    
    If you want to use this library from multiple Xcode targets, or mix Xcode targets and SPM targets, you must create a shared framework that depends on **ComposableArchitecture** and then depend on that framework in all of your targets.
    
    <Note>
      For an example of using TCA with multiple modules, check out the [Tic-Tac-Toe demo](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/tree/main/Examples/TicTacToe), which splits features into modules and consumes them using a shared Swift package.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Package.swift

If you're building a Swift package, you can add the Composable Architecture as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift Package.swift
let package = Package(
  name: "MyPackage",
  platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),
    .macOS(.v13),
    .tvOS(.v16),
    .watchOS(.v9),
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(
      url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture",
      from: "1.0.0"
    )
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "MyTarget",
      dependencies: [
        .product(
          name: "ComposableArchitecture",
          package: "swift-composable-architecture"
        )
      ]
    )
  ]
)
```

## Dependencies

The Composable Architecture brings in several dependencies that provide essential functionality:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core dependencies">
    - **swift-dependencies**: Dependency management system
    - **swift-identified-collections**: Collection types with stable identity
    - **swift-case-paths**: Key path abstractions for enum cases
    - **swift-perception**: Observation tools for iOS &lt;17
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Testing dependencies">
    - **swift-custom-dump**: Enhanced dump output for tests
    - **xctest-dynamic-overlay**: XCTest support in library code
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Effect dependencies">
    - **combine-schedulers**: Testable Combine schedulers
    - **swift-clocks**: Testable time-based operations
    - **swift-concurrency-extras**: Swift concurrency utilities
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  All dependencies are automatically managed by Swift Package Manager. You don't need to add them individually.
</Note>

## Import the library

Once installed, import the Composable Architecture in your Swift files:

```swift
import ComposableArchitecture
```

## Verify installation

To verify the installation was successful, try creating a simple reducer:

```swift
import ComposableArchitecture

@Reducer
struct Feature {
  @ObservableState
  struct State: Equatable {
    var count = 0
  }
  
  enum Action {
    case incrementButtonTapped
  }
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .incrementButtonTapped:
        state.count += 1
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If this compiles without errors, the installation was successful!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build errors about missing types">
    Make sure you've imported `ComposableArchitecture` at the top of your file:
    
    ```swift
    import ComposableArchitecture
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deployment target errors">
    Verify your deployment target meets the minimum requirements:
    - iOS 16.0+
    - macOS 13.0+
    - tvOS 16.0+
    - watchOS 9.0+
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Package resolution failures">
    Try these steps:
    1. In Xcode, go to **File** → **Packages** → **Reset Package Caches**
    2. Clean the build folder (**Product** → **Clean Build Folder**)
    3. Restart Xcode
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next steps

Now that you've installed the Composable Architecture, you're ready to build your first feature!
