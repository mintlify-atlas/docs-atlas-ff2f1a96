## Overview

The Composable Architecture is under constant development, and we are always looking for ways to simplify the library, and make it more powerful. As such, we often need to deprecate certain APIs in favor of newer ones. We recommend people update their code as quickly as possible to the newest APIs, and these guides contain tips to do so.

<Warning>
Before following any particular migration guide be sure you have followed all the preceding migration guides.
