title: Migrating to 1.17
description: The @Shared property wrapper and related tools have been extracted to their own library so that they can be used in non-Composable Architecture applications
---

## Overview

The [Sharing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing) package is a general purpose, state-sharing and persistence toolkit that works on all platforms supported by Swift, including iOS/macOS, Linux, Windows, Wasm, and more.

We released two versions of this package simultaneously: a [0.1](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing/releases/0.1.0) version that is a backwards-compatible version of the tools that shipped with the Composable Architecture &lt;1.16, as well as a [1.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing/releases/1.0.0) version with some non-backwards compatible changes.

<Warning>
This is a backwards compatible change, but some new deprecations have been introduced. The `@Shared` property wrapper has been extracted to a separate library.
</Warning>

## Staying on the backwards-compatible version

If you wish to remain on the backwards-compatible version of Sharing for the time being, then you can add an explicit dependency on the library to pin to any version less than 1.0:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing", from: "0.1.0"),
```

## Upgrading to Sharing 1.0

If you are ready to upgrade to 1.0, then you can follow the [1.0 migration guide](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing/main/documentation/sharing/migratingto1.0) from that package.
