`StoreOf<R>` is a type alias that simplifies store type declarations by consolidating a reducer's state and action types into a single generic parameter.

## Declaration

```swift
public typealias StoreOf<R: Reducer> = Store<R.State, R.Action>
```

## Overview

Instead of specifying both state and action types as separate generics, `StoreOf` allows you to reference a store using only the reducer type. This reduces verbosity and improves readability throughout your SwiftUI views.

### Before StoreOf

```swift
struct FeatureView: View {
  let store: Store<Feature.State, Feature.Action>
  
  var body: some View {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### With StoreOf

```swift
struct FeatureView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<Feature>
  
  var body: some View {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Usage

`StoreOf` is particularly useful in SwiftUI view declarations where you need to accept a store parameter:

```swift
@Reducer
struct Counter {
  @ObservableState
  struct State: Equatable {
    var count = 0
  }
  
  enum Action {
    case increment
    case decrement
  }
  
  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .increment:
        state.count += 1
        return .none
      case .decrement:
        state.count -= 1
        return .none
      }
    }
  }
}

struct CounterView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<Counter>
  
  var body: some View {
    HStack {
      Button("-") { store.send(.decrement) }
      Text("\(store.count)")
      Button("+") { store.send(.increment) }
    }
  }
}
```

## Scoping with StoreOf

`StoreOf` works seamlessly with store scoping operations:

```swift
@Reducer
struct AppFeature {
  @ObservableState
  struct State {
    var counter1 = Counter.State()
    var counter2 = Counter.State()
  }
  
  enum Action {
    case counter1(Counter.Action)
    case counter2(Counter.Action)
  }
  
  // ...
}

struct AppView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<AppFeature>
  
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      CounterView(
        store: store.scope(state: \.counter1, action: \.counter1)
      )
      CounterView(
        store: store.scope(state: \.counter2, action: \.counter2)
      )
    }
  }
}
```
