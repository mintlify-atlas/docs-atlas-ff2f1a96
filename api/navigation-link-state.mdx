## Overview

`NavigationLink(state:)` is a SwiftUI view initializer that integrates with The Composable Architecture's stack-based navigation. It allows you to create navigation links that push new state onto a `StackState` collection when tapped.

This is the primary way to navigate to new screens in stack-based navigation with TCA.

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

Create a navigation link by providing the state to push onto the stack:

```swift
NavigationLink(
  "Go to Detail",
  state: Path.State.detail(DetailFeature.State())
)
```

### With NavigationStack

Use with `NavigationStack` and a binding to the store's path:

```swift
struct RootView: View {
  @Bindable var store: StoreOf<RootFeature>
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationStack(path: $store.scope(state: \.path, action: \.path)) {
      Form {
        NavigationLink(
          "Go to Screen A",
          state: Path.State.screenA(ScreenA.State())
        )
        NavigationLink(
          "Go to Screen B",
          state: Path.State.screenB(ScreenB.State())
        )
      }
      .navigationTitle("Root")
    } destination: { store in
      switch store.case {
      case .screenA(let store):
        ScreenAView(store: store)
      case .screenB(let store):
        ScreenBView(store: store)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Complete Example

```swift
@Reducer
struct NavigationDemo {
  @Reducer
  enum Path {
    case screenA(ScreenA)
    case screenB(ScreenB)
    case screenC(ScreenC)
  }
  
  @ObservableState
  struct State {
    var path = StackState<Path.State>()
  }
  
  enum Action {
    case path(StackActionOf<Path>)
  }
  
  var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      // Parent logic
    }
    .forEach(\.path, action: \.path)
  }
}

struct NavigationDemoView: View {
  @Bindable var store: StoreOf<NavigationDemo>
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationStack(path: $store.scope(state: \.path, action: \.path)) {
      Form {
        NavigationLink(
          "Go to Screen A",
          state: NavigationDemo.Path.State.screenA(ScreenA.State())
        )
        NavigationLink(
          "Go to Screen B",
          state: NavigationDemo.Path.State.screenB(ScreenB.State())
        )
      }
      .navigationTitle("Root")
    } destination: { store in
      switch store.case {
      case .screenA(let store):
        ScreenAView(store: store)
      case .screenB(let store):
        ScreenBView(store: store)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Passing Data to Child

You can pass data from the parent to the child state:

```swift
NavigationLink(
  "Go to Detail",
  state: Path.State.detail(
    DetailFeature.State(count: store.count)
  )
)
```

### Custom Label

Use the trailing closure syntax for custom labels:

```swift
NavigationLink(state: Path.State.detail(DetailFeature.State())) {
  HStack {
    Image(systemName: "star")
    Text("Go to Detail")
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. When a `NavigationLink(state:)` is tapped, it sends a `StackAction.push` action to the store
2. The action includes both an auto-generated ID and the state to push
3. The `forEach` reducer operator intercepts this action and appends the state to the `StackState`
4. SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` observes the change and pushes the new screen
5. The destination closure renders the appropriate view based on the state

## Key Points

- **Type-Safe**: The state must match the type expected by the `StackState`
- **Automatic IDs**: Stack element IDs are generated automatically
- **Declarative**: Navigation is driven entirely by state changes
- **Deep Links**: You can programmatically append multiple states to navigate deep into the stack
